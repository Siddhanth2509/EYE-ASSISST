## 📊 Dataset Used

* **EyePACS** – Diabetic Retinopathy retinal fundus images
  Used for large-scale data engineering and preprocessing pipeline validation.

Additional datasets (ODIR, Cataract, AMD) will be integrated in later phases using the same pipeline.

## 📌 Status

🟢 Phase 1A — Completed
## 🧠 Phase 2A — CNN Strategy & Training Design (Conceptual Phase)

> **Status:** ✅ Active
> **Nature:** Decision-making & justification only
> **Code Level:** ❌ No heavy model training yet

Phase 2A focuses on **thinking like a Machine Learning engineer before writing code**.
This phase is intentionally designed to lock **critical design decisions** for a medical AI system **before any CNN training begins**.

---

## 🔒 Phase 1 Freeze (Precondition)

Phase 2A operates under a strict data freeze:

* ✅ Data engineering — **finalized**
* ✅ Preprocessing — **finalized**
* ✅ Train / Validation / Test splits — **finalized**
* ✅ Manifest CSV — **finalized**

🚫 During Phase 2A:

* No data modification
* No preprocessing changes
* No reshuffling of splits

This ensures **clean, reproducible ML experiments** and prevents data leakage.

---

## 🎯 Objective of Phase 2A

The goal is to design a **clinically meaningful, generalizable CNN training strategy** for diabetic retinopathy screening — not just to maximize accuracy.

Phase 2A emphasizes:

* Clinical relevance
* Dataset realism
* External generalization
* Interview-ready justification

---

## 🧩 Decisions Covered in Phase 2A (In Order)

### 1️⃣ Binary vs Multi-Class Classification

**Decision Scope**

* NORMAL vs DR (screening-oriented)
* Why multi-class severity prediction is postponed

**Focus**

* Clinical screening relevance
* Label noise in DR severity grades
* Improved generalization to external datasets (APTOS)

---

### 2️⃣ Loss Functions for Medical AI

**Options Considered**

* Binary Cross Entropy
* BCE with class weights
* Focal Loss

**Focus**

* Why false negatives are more dangerous than false positives
* How loss functions encode clinical risk
* Practical trade-offs (calibration vs recall)

---

### 3️⃣ Metrics Beyond Accuracy

**Metrics Evaluated**

* Sensitivity (Recall for DR)
* Specificity
* AUC-ROC
* Precision–Recall trade-off

**Focus**

* Why accuracy is misleading in imbalanced medical datasets
* Selecting a **primary metric** aligned with clinical goals
* Supporting metrics for diagnostic insight

---

### 4️⃣ Class Imbalance Handling

**Strategies Compared**

* Class weighting
* Oversampling
* Undersampling

**Focus**

* Why imbalance was **not corrected at split time**
* Maintaining real-world data distribution
* Choosing one strategy for controlled experimentation

---

### 5️⃣ Training Protocol: EyePACS → APTOS

**Experimental Design**

* Train on EyePACS
* Validate on EyePACS
* Test on APTOS (external dataset)

**Focus**

* Measuring real generalization, not memorization
* Interpreting good vs bad cross-dataset results
* Elevating the project from “CNN training” to **generalization evaluation**

---

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Workflow (Vibe Coding, Done Right)

This project follows a **modern AI-assisted ML workflow**:

* **ChatGPT** → strategy, reasoning, and justification
* **Perplexity AI** → evidence checks & best-practice validation
* **Notion / Markdown** → decision logs
* **Cursor** → implementation (Phase 2B onward)
* **W&B** → experiment tracking (Phase 2B onward)

> AI tools are used to **enhance thinking**, not replace ML fundamentals.

---

## 🚦 Exit Criteria for Phase 2A

Phase 2A is considered complete when:

* All five decisions are **locked and documented**
* Each decision has **clear clinical + ML justification**
* The training strategy is **interview-defensible**
* No code shortcuts are taken

Only after this will the project move to **Phase 2B — CNN Implementation & Training**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Phase Matters

Phase 2A ensures the model is:

* Clinically meaningful
* Scientifically valid
* Reproducible
* Generalization-focused

This transforms the project from:

> *“I trained a CNN”*

to:

> *“I designed and evaluated a medical AI system with external validation.”*

---
